            <h2>Latest Updates</h2>
            <h2>Responsibly empowering developers with AI on MDN</h2>
<h3>JULY 6, 2023 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STEVE TEIXEIRA</h3>
Generative AI technologies powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have shown themselves to be both a big boon to productivity as well as a concerningly confident purveyor of incorrect information. At Mozilla, we’re excited about the potential role generative AI can play in creating new value for people while demonstrating leadership in responsible and ethical implementation approaches.
One domain where we see high value is in training LLMs on reference documentation, enabling developers to more quickly find solutions or get answers about the purpose or behavior of code snippets. MDN’s mission is to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new generation of developers and content creators to build it. We see a path forward to “overlay” useful AI-driven helpers on top of MDN’s canonical web dev documentation to aid developers in new ways. Of course, human-authored canonical documentation will always be available and clearly called out as such. To this end, last week, MDN launched AI integrations with its body of web developer reference documentation, manifesting in two features that have been in development over the last few months: AI Help and AI Explain, both powered by GPT-3.5. 
AI Help enables MDN readers to ask questions with a conversational interface, and the tool offers concise answers with MDN articles related to their questions for contextual help. AI Help is limited to offering information only based on MDN content, and is now in beta and available to logged-in MDN readers.
AI Explain enables readers to explore and understand code blocks and parts of code examples embedded in MDN documentation pages, describing the underlying purpose and behavior of the code. AI Explain is still an experimental tool.
Our internal work on these tools has us hugely optimistic about their potential to save developers tons of time as they seek answers and learning resources. Early-stage developers appear to benefit most, as they are least likely to know exactly where to go or which keywords to search for to find the answers they seek. As we’re still in the early stages, we’re also seeing instances where these AI tools provide incorrect information in response to a query. The MDN team is working to identify these cases and develop fixes so that we can continuously raise the quality and utility of the answers provided by AI Help and AI Explain. We are also planning to make it easier for people to flag bad answers, creating issues sent to the team to investigate. In the end, our goal is to make MDN more accessible and useful to a wider variety of developers, without diminishing MDN’s role as the canonical reference source for high-quality information about developing for the web.
<h2>Feedback Matters</h2>
With the launches of AI Help and AI Explain last week, we received a wide range of feedback from readers, from delight to constructive criticisms to concerns about the technical accuracy of the responses. We’re only a handful of days into the journey, but the data so far seems to indicate a sense of skepticism towards AI and LLMs in general, while those who have tried the features to find answers tend to be happy with the results.
